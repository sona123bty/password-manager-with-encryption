# Decentralized Password Manager DApp

## Project Title
**SecureVault DApp** - A Blockchain-Based Encrypted Password Manager

## Project Description
SecureVault DApp is a decentralized password manager built on blockchain technology that allows users to securely store, manage, and retrieve their passwords in a trustless environment. The application leverages smart contracts to ensure data integrity and user ownership while implementing client-side encryption to maintain privacy and security.

Unlike traditional password managers that rely on centralized servers, SecureVault DApp gives users complete control over their data by storing encrypted passwords on the blockchain. Each user's passwords are encrypted client-side before being stored on-chain, ensuring that even if the blockchain data is public, the actual passwords remain secure and accessible only to the owner.

The DApp features a clean, intuitive interface that interacts seamlessly with Web3 wallets, making it easy for users to manage their digital credentials while maintaining the highest security standards.

## Project Vision
Our vision is to revolutionize password management by creating a truly decentralized, user-owned solution that eliminates single points of failure and puts users in complete control of their digital identity. We aim to build a future where:

- **Data Sovereignty**: Users own and control their password data without relying on centralized authorities
- **Enhanced Security**: Client-side encryption ensures passwords remain secure even in a public blockchain environment
- **Global Accessibility**: Anyone with an internet connection and a Web3 wallet can access their passwords from anywhere
- **Censorship Resistance**: No central authority can restrict or deny access to user data
- **Transparency**: Open-source smart contracts provide full transparency and auditability
- **Interoperability**: Seamless integration with various Web3 wallets and blockchain ecosystems
